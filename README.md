# SpamDetection_Undergrad

The implementation of a Na√Øve Bayes Spam Filter is relatively straight forward using scikit-learn, however, this library hides the implementation details (and many solutions are available on the Internet).  Therefore, this task does not permit the use of the scikit-learn library or similar libraries that perform similar tasks.  We hope that this will help with your understanding of the implementation details
Bayes Theorem can give us the probability that a message is spam S for a given event E

We have tried to keep the implementation quite simple and therefore not accounted for things like filtering small often used words, nor does the implementation calculate probabilities of a word in the frequency list not appearing in spam.  We have also filtered things like telephone numbers, which could be used to identify spam.   The final exercise allows you to make recommendations how the model could be improved.
